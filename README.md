## Note
This code may be a bit complicated, because I combined the linklist and array and it may be difficult to differentiate them, 
but what needs to be noted is that the dynamic task list section is a link list.

## Introduction
The task for this OOP is to create a Daily Task Manager in Java using arrays, stacks, and linked lists.

## Environment Setup
- JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 23.0.2
- VSC

## Challenges
- This is my long and tedious progress because it has to display a link list, stack, array so there are many columns.
- To be honest, I mostly use chatgpt because I'm confused about making link lists and stacks in Java, and also some of the codes are from gpt and some are original ones that I made myself even though there are many errors, I have to ask in gpt too
